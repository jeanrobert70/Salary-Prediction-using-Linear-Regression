# Predicting new hire Salary using Machine Learning

This notebook looks into using linear regression in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable of predicting a new employee's salary based on their years of experience. 

This is a simple data where dataset where I utilized linear regression algorithm to obtain our objective.
This data consists of salary and years of experience of 35 jobholders. I will show the relationship between salary and years of experience.

We're going to take the follow approach:

1. Problem Defintiion
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation
